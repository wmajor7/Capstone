# Kingdom Intro
A kingdom in ruin lays in the cavern consisting on multiple different items in the vast ocean. Once a place of great magical advancments now only infested streets and markets filled with creatures that are only empty husks of what they used to be. The Greenhouses that once proveded food for the city contain overgrown monsters never before seen by the cities inhabitants. The prison now infested with husks of prisoners and horrors beyond your imagination. The capital city, while in pristine condition thanks to the magical automotons are barron. The kingdom and its people are gone, destroyed, and forgotten. What could have caused this?
