# Arcstone

Arcstones are a crystal that grow on the stalictites of the cavern. They glow blue with a mysterious magical energy drawn from a magical plane known as The Sear. Once the kingdom discovered these crystals they learned of their ability to power artifacts and general machienry. They were used for all tasks from powering rails, factories, automatons and  other [[Arcstone macheniery]] to also powering magic artifacts such as elemental gauntlets and [[Arsctone magic]].

Arcstones however do have a downside however. While acessing the power of The Sear a dark corruption magic leaks into this world and corrupts those exposed to it over a long period of time. Once the arcstone is depleted of all its abilities its starts emitting only this corruption magic. This magic leak can be reduced by refining the stones but not completley erased. The refinment process was long and resource intensive so only the wealthy upper class had access to them and the information about corruption magic was intentionally kept from the lower class who used unrefined arcstones for almost everything. The sea life were also exposed to the arcstones corruption as once an arcstone was depleted it would be tossed into the ocean.

As time went on people began mutating into mindless bloodthirsty husks of their formerselves with enhanced abilities. No one knew the cause of what they thought was a plague but once word got out that the arcstones were the reason [[The Rebellion]] began.

The corruption emitted from the arstones eventaully mutated the sealife in to [[Searedzver]]
